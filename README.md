# Portfolio - Mohamed Amine Marnissi

As a research engineer in deep learning and computer vision, I bring expertise in developing advanced algorithms for image and video analysis, object recognition, and neural network architecture design. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence, and a PhD in Computer Systems Technology. I am a freelance professional with a proven track record of publishing in high-impact journals and conferences. Passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest advancements in my field, I attend conferences and workshops, and am a member of research communities and professional organizations.

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my personal projects, work samples, and research papers.
